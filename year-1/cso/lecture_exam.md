Present the given number in the NKB, BCD, U1, U2 codes as positive and negative value
===
**Note for each one: It is important to leave the first bit of each 'open' to signify the sign.**
## NBC (NBK)- Natural Binary Code
It is important to leave the first bit of each 'open' to signify the sign.

It is just a binary representation of a number with predetermined number of bits. Example:<br>
67 into 8-bit natural binary code:<br>
01000011

## Gray Code
It is obtained by shifting the NBC number by 1 to the left and performing XOR on the new number with the unshifted one and discarding the last bit of the original. Example: <br>
001000011 - NBC<br>
01000011 - NBC shifted<br>
01100010 - Gray code<br>

## 1's Complement (U1)
To obtain this complement we need to take each bit of the number and switch to the opposite. Example:<br>
01000011 - NBC<br>
10111100 - 1's Complement

## 2's Complement (U2)
To obtain this complement we first need to get 1's complement then add 1. Example:<br>
01000011 - NBC<br>
10111100 -1's Complement<br>
10111101 -2's Complement<br>

**NOTE: Both in U1 and U2 a positive number is represented the same as NBC, negatives, as described above.**

Present the given number in hexadecimal code
===
## Hexadecimal code
It is a number system of base 16, it shares numbers 0-9 with the decimal system, larger numbers are represented with letters A-F.

The easiest method to convert a number into HEX is to first convert it into binary, then create groups of 4 bits, starting from bit standing at 2^0, and calculate the values. Example:<br>
67 - decimal<br>
01000011 - 8-bit NBC<br>
0100 | 0011 - 2 groups of 4 bits<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3 - values of the groups<br>
 43 - HEX <br>

Present the given number as negative in the 2'complement
===
Following the instructions above: <br>
67 - decimal positive<br>
01000011 - 8-bit NBC<br>
10111100 - 1's Complement<br>
10111101 - 2's Complement = -67 in decimal <br>

Perform simple calculations for two numbers in the 1'complement
===
## Subtraction in U1
It's just addition with one of the numbers 'flipped' to U1.
Addition is the same as in NBC, but if there exists a carry it is added at the end. Example: <br>
-67 10111100<br>
+68 01000100<br><br>
1 00000000 - incorrect sum, carry<br>
00000001 - correct sum after correction 

Perform simple calculations for two numbers in the 2'complement
===
Operations in U2 follow the same rules as in U1, except in the case of a carry existing, it is discarded.
## Addition in U2
Example:<br>
-67 10111101<br>
+68 01000100<br><br>
 1 - carry is discarded<br>
00000001 - correct sum <br>

Multiplication of two binary numbers
===
Numbers in binary are multiplied similarly to decimal, we simply rewrite the first number under every 1 of the second, shifting it, so it starts at the same 'spot' as the 1, and then adding them. Example:<br><br>
 67 01000011<br>
 *5 00000101<br><br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;01000011<br>
 	&#43; 01000011<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;0101001111 = 335 <br>

Adding two numbers in the BCD and EXCESS-3 code
===
## BCD
In this code, each decimal digit is represented by 4 binary bits corresponding to that digit. Example:<br>
67 - decimal<br>
0110 0111 - BCD code <br>

## Excess-3
It is a modified BCD code, instead of representing the digit itself, we represent digit greater than original by 3. Example:<br>
67 - decimal<br>
9 10 - digits increased by 3<br>
1001 1010 - Excess-3 <br>

*SR latch can be created with two NOR gates that have a cross-feedback loop.*


## Description
A **SR (Set-Reset) latch** serves as a memory device and is an asynchronous block. Therefore you must ensure that the combinational functions, which generate input signals for the latch, are race-free. Otherwise they may generate glitches, which may be latched, causing hazards in your system.

#### Race condition
The latch is being told to simultaneously produce a high Q and a low Q. This produces a "race condition" within the circuit - whichever flip flop succeeds in changing first will feedback to the other and assert itself. Ideally, both gates are identical and this is "metastable", and the device will be in an undefined state for an indefinite period. In real life, due to manufacturing methods, one gate will always win, but it's impossible to tell which it will be for a particular device from an assembly line. The state of S = R = 1 is therefore **"illegal"** and should never be entered.

Describe static-hazards
===
## Static hazard
A static hazard is the situation where, when one input variable changes, the output changes momentarily before stabilizing to the correct value. There are two types of static hazards:

- **Static-1 Hazard**: the output is currently 1 and after the inputs change, the output momentarily changes to 0,1 before settling on 1

- **Static-0 Hazard**: the output is currently 0 and after the inputs change, the output momentarily changes to 1,0 before settling on 0
In properly formed two-level AND-OR logic based on a Sum Of Products expression, there will be no static-0 hazards. Conversely, there will be no static-1 hazards in an OR-AND implementation of a Product Of Sums expression.

The most commonly used method to eliminate static hazards is to add redundant logic (consensus terms in the logic expression) with the help of Karnaugh map method.

## Example of a static hazard
Consider a simple imperfect circuit that suffers from a delay in the physical logic elements i.e. AND gates. It performs the function noting:

f = X1 * X2 + X1' * X3

If no delays were to occur, then the circuit would function normally. However, no two gates are ever manufactured identically. Due to this, the delay for the first AND gate will be slightly different than its counterpart. Thus an error occurs when the input changes from 111 to 011. i.e. when X1 changes state.

Now we know roughly how the hazard is occurring, for a clearer picture and the solution on how to solve this problem, we would look to the Karnaugh map. The two gates are shown by solid rings, and the hazard can be seen under the dashed ring. A theorem proved by Huffman tells us that by adding a redundant loop 'X2X3' this will eliminate the hazard.

So our original function is now: f = X1 * X2 + X1' * X3 + X2 * X3
